          <p>I have to confess something: I am not that eager to become a contributor of open source projects. I have made several commits into the main line of <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17312" target="_blank">python</a>, <a href="http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/hostap/2016-May/035692.html" target="_blank">wpa_supplicant</a> and GStreamer but it was not because I wanted to become a contributor of the project but because I found an issue, which looked to be very likely to happen to other users and me in the future, so I did. Therefore, my contributions were not as noble as others by enthusiastic contributors.</p>

          <p>I highly respect all the contibutors of the open source projects regardless of what they have in mind. It is partly true that experience in open source will beautify your CV making an impression on some people. Some of the juniors tend to admire the open source contributors, although not many professionals think the contributors are more skillful engineers. At least, the contribution ensures the contributor is capable of finding an issue from current source code of the project and coming up with a resolution to the problem.</p>

          <p>By the way, the reason I think that the open source contributors deserve their reputation is their attitude. </p>

          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Being an open source contributor means proactive and voluntary.</span>
          <p>They are proactive as no one asks for it, themselves are those who fix a bug they found, and they are willing to change their own style into the rule of project owner for contribution.</p>

          <p>As well as they are volutary since most of them are not officially hired for the maintenance of the project. No one pays for it, the contribution takes contributors' own private time which is the most precious resource of human being, usually there is nothing left but self-satisfaction as an individual commit is going to be buried by hundreds or thousands of others, and the work is for other people who will go through the same bug.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Get into the situation</h2>

          <p>Let's assume that you already have enough spirit of charity. Prerequisite fulfilled. While you are using one of the open source library or something, you have encountered an issue that it does not work as intended. In this case you are given 3 choices. You may <i><b>choose another open source</b></i>, <i><b>report the bug to the maintainers of the project</b></i>, or <i><b>start debugging of the issue</b></i>. The choices are given in the similar way when you read some 'getting started' document and found a typo or something wrong. You may <i><b>ignore it</b></i>, <i><b>report to the maintainers</i></b>, or <i><b>fix it on your own.</i></b></p>

            <center><img class="img-fluid" src="../img/oss-3ways.jpg" alt="3 ways to choose"></center>
          </a>

          <p>For both situation, the roads to the contributor are the last ones, though reporting a bug can also be regarded as contribution in a broader perspective. Somehow the contribution would involve the reporting step.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Patch work process</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">How to?</h2>

          <p>Mostly, the contribution begins with reading CONTRIBUTION file. That kind of a file or a section elaborates step-by-step instruction and rules to do contribution. You will submit a bug report to the bug tracking system or via email to the group of maintainers as the guide document. </p>


          <p>A few years ago, I visited Japan for travel. I spoke English on my first day and felt huge frustration in communication. So I spent that night to refresh my knowledge in Japanese which I studied for 4 years during high school and university. It was not that difficult as I felt like it was yet alive in my body and brain. From next day, I had no problem.</p>

          <p>Last year, I went business trip to Shenzhen, China. I took an Elementary Chinese class for 3 months more than 5 years ago. Since business language was English there were no problem at work. But there were always problems elsewhere. I was not able to come back to my hotel because taxi driver did not understand English name of my hotel and I did not know how to pronounce the name in Chinese. So, simply I learnt it. It was definately easier than when I studied Japanese not because Chinese is easier than Japanese but because I am trained learning a new language. With the similarity in vocabulary I can see that there are something common that accelerate the progress. Anyway, I had no problem from next day, on coming back to the hotel, at least.</p>

          <p>My point is, language is not a barrier to me. It just needs a couple of months to use, that's it. If I come across a new (key)word, I just go open a dictionary/search google. This takes tiny fraction of my time and won't repeat more than 5 times, from my experience I'm sure of that.</p>

          <p>Language is not a problem to me. I am accustomed to heterogeneity. And fortunately, I like a new challenge.</p>
